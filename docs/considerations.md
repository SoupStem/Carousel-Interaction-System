## **Conclusion and Final Considerations**

This documentation covers the mandatory steps required to integrate and configure the **Inventory Carousel** and its associated Interaction System.

With all components and data assets correctly linked, your system is now fully operational, providing a robust foundation for your inventory management and player interactions.

**Final Considerations for Customization**

1. **Customizing Visual Assets:** All input assets, UMG widgets, and the default ***BP_InventoryScene*** (the scene capture actor) found in the plugin's content folder are provided as examples and are **fully customizable**. We highly encourage you to modify these assets to match your project's unique artistic style and visual language.
2. **Overwriting Components:** Remember that you can always create your own Blueprints that inherit from the base plugin classes (e.g., ***InventoryPlayerController***, ***InventoryManagerComponent***) to implement custom logic while retaining all the core
3. **Offsets and Scene Capture:** Pay close attention to the **Local Offset** and **Depth Space** parameters in your Slot and Item Data Assets. These are critical for achieving the desired 3D presentation within the inventory carousel.

**Acknowledgements and Next Steps**

Thank you for choosing the Inventory Carousel plugin for your project. We hope this technical documentation has provided clear and professional guidance for a seamless integration process.

We wish you the best of luck with the development of your game!
